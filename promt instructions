make the import csv file feature work; it doesn't let me select a file. I have imports from different banks that look different, and have different column names. make sure to make it work for all of them and is flexiable.

create a universal semantic and exact search for transactions, that show matching transactions, 
each transaction amount, the total of all the transactions in the search result,
if the transactions were the same but changed, how much the changes are,
when the changes happened, how much the changes are based on sesonality, 
what future changes are predicted and when based on historical data,
And a few helpful interactive charts and insights based on the search results.
